/**
 * TYPE 2 — SetMetadata
 *
 * SetMetadata attaches arbitrary data to a route handler or controller class.
 * That data is later read by a Guard (or Interceptor) via the Reflector service.
 *
 * This is the NestJS way to implement role-based access control (RBAC):
 * 1. Annotate routes with @Roles('admin')
 * 2. In a RolesGuard, read the metadata with Reflector and compare to req.user.roles
 *
 * The key ('roles') is a contract between the decorator and the guard.
 * Using a const avoids typos between the two sides.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   @Roles('admin')
 *   @Delete(':id')
 *   remove(...) { ... }
 *
